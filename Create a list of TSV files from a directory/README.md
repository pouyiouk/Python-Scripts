# create_list_of_tsv_files
Easy way of creating a list (in a txt file) of TSV files inside a folder.

Once the initial list is created, is saved in the directory where the first TSV files are present.
Each time the script is initiated, the folder is scanned for new files, by comparing
the directory with the list. If new files are detected in the directory, the list is appended with the new
file names.
