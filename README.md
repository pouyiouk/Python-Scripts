# Python Scripts

All the code in these script examples was written by me. This repository will contain code bits from some other scripts that I have developed that I do not want to open source.
This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is in it's contained folder to distinguish one script from another.

To run the scripts from the Download code button on the main repository page:
-Clone this repository to your desktop via Github Desktop
-Download as zipped folder directly and extract

Then from there just import each script individually into Jupyter Notebook.

To install visit: https://jupyter.org/install to install individually Jupyter Notebook.
To install Anaconda Navigator containing all nescssary tools for Data Science purposes(including Jupyter Notebook) visit: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
