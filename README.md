# Python Scripts

All the code in these script examples was written by me. This repository will contain code bits from some other scripts that I have developed that I do not want to open source.
This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is in it's contained folder to distinguish one script from another.

## Python Scripts:

#### TSV to SQL
#### TSV List comparison with directory
#### HEX to ASCII converter
#### Morse code translator
#### Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm

To run the scripts from the Download code button on the main repository page:
-Clone this repository to your desktop via Github Desktop
-Download as zipped folder directly and extract

Then from there just import each script individually into Jupyter Notebook.

To install visit: https://jupyter.org/install to install individually Jupyter Notebook.
